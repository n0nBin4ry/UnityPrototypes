# Playing With Fire
Handcrafted sequencial-puzzle experience. And a mix of some homages.

Was really an excuse for me to write some jokes, practice grid-based retro-pokemon movement, and other little ideas in my head.

Almost ready for a free (I borrowed some assests very hard; will credit them still) release, just adding some more juice and an AI component that shall remain secret to those who will play it.
Also may rewrite some jokes so that you don't need to know who Andy Nealen is or about his podcast to get the jokes.
