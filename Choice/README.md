Content Warning: The game's themes may cause discomfort and have evoked negative emotions in some prototype testers.

A game where players have to make impossible choices. Sound Design and Game Pieces' interactions/behaviors may invoke emotions.

Will polish, add even more robust interactions, and MAYBE demystify the theme and give it a diagetic theme that is more closer to current events.
Wear a mask; it's so fucking easy.
