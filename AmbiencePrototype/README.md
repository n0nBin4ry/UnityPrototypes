# Ambient Runner (working title)
Prototype where I delve hard into implimenting dynamic audio systems. 
There is dynamic foley that changes based on surface/zones 
and dynamic ambiance that blends ambiant sounds/effects together when transitioning between zones.

Currently integrating Wwise to practice using middleware for more audio call/effect control; 
and also adding a parkour mechanic to make more interesting interactions for the sound system.
